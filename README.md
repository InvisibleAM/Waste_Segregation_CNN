# Waste_Segregation_CNN

This repository contains the resources and Jupyter notebooks presented during the CFI Summer School 2022, covering key concepts in data science and machine learning. The topics include  `NumPy` and `Pandas`, as well as methods such as Neural Networks (NNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

## Contents

1. **`np and pds.ipynb`**  
   - Introduces the foundational libraries `NumPy` and `Pandas`.
   - Explains essential operations such as array manipulations, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.

2. **`summer_school_weather_linear_reg.ipynb`**  
   - Implements a linear regression model on weather data.
     
3. **`NN-summer_school.ipynb`**  
   - Focuses on building and training a simple Neural Network (NN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Includes explanations of activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques.

4. **`AWS_CNN_summer_school.ipynb`**  
   - Demonstrates the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow.
   - Covers preprocessing, training, and evaluating a CNN on a dataset of waste images.
